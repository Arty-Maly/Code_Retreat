# Code_Retreat
Starting Code For a Code Retreat

There are two folders lib, spec. lib is where your classes can go and spec is where the test should live :)
There is a spec helper that automatically requires every .rb file in your lib directory and subdirectories.

To run the tests run rspec in the root of the project.

For every new test require 'spec_helper'
